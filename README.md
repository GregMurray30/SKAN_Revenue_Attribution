# POC SKAN_Revenue_Attribution
Cohort Install Attribution Model



This work is a "quick and dirty" prototype that provides a means to derive priors for the media mix model for campaign revenue attribution for SKAN.
Files cohort_attribution.RMD and cohort_attribution_v2.stan serve as a toy simulation for demonstration purposes. See the former library calls for dependencies.


See SKAN_Revenue_Cohort_Attribution_V2.docx for POC description and model derivations.
